A collection of code for learning, using, evaluating, and visualizing abstractions in Reinforcement Learning in Python. This code is used to run experiments for our 2018 ICML paper: [State Abstractions for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning](https://david-abel.github.io/papers/lifelong_sa_icml_18.pdf) and the earlier workshop paper [Toward Good Abstractions for Lifelong Learning](http://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/papers/nips_hrl_good_abstr.pdf), presented at the NIPS Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Workshop in 2017.

Experiments require [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl), which can be installed with the usual:

	pip install simple_rl

For the ICML paper, run _run_icml_learning_experiments.py_ to reproduce plots from Figure 4 and Figure 5. Run _run_icml_planning_experiments.py_ to reproduce plots from Figure 6.
