A collection of code for learning, using, evaluating, and visualizing abstractions in Reinforcement Learning. This code is used to run experiments for our paper: [Toward Good Abstractions for Lifelong Learning](http://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/papers/nips_hrl_good_abstr.pdf), presented at the NIPS Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Workshop in 2017.

Experiments require [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl), which can be installed with the usual:

	pip install simple_rl

To reproduce the code associated with the paper run _simple_sa_experimentys.py_.
